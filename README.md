## EdDSA Data Integrity Cryptosuites

This specification describes a Data Integrity cryptographic suite for use when
creating or verifying a digital signature using the twisted Edwards Curve
Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) and Curve25519 (ed25519). The approach is
accepted by the U.S. National Institute of Standards in the latest FIPS 186-5
draft and, after ratification, is expected to meet U.S. Federal Information
Processing requirements when using cryptography to secure digital information.

We encourage contributions meeting the
[Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md). While we prefer the creation of
issues and Pull Requests in the GitHub repository, discussions also occur on the
[public-vc-wg](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-vc-wg/) mailing list.

## Process Overview for VC Data Model Pull Requests
1. Anyone can open a PR on the repository. Note that for the PR to be merged,
   the individual must agree to the
   [W3C Patent Policy](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/).
2. Once a PR is opened, it will be reviewed by the Editors and other WG
   Members.
3. The W3C CCG is automatically notified of PRs as they are raised and
   discussed.
4. PRs are usually merged in 7 days if there is adequate review and consensus,
   as determined by the Chairs and Editors.
