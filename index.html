      <p>
This specification describes a Data Integrity cryptographic suite for use when
creating or verifying a digital signature using the twisted Edwards Curve
Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) and Curve25519 (ed25519).

      <p>
The Working Group is actively seeking implementation feedback for this
specification. In order to exit the Candidate Recommendation phase, the
Working Group has set the requirement of at least two independent
implementations for each mandatory feature in the specification. For details
on the conformance testing process, see the test suites listed in the
<a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-integrity/implementations/">
implementation report</a>.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
This specification defines a cryptographic suite for the purpose of creating,
verifying proofs for Ed25519 EdDSA signatures in conformance with the
Data Integrity [[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]] specification. The approach is
accepted by the U.S. National Institute of Standards in the latest FIPS 186-5
publication and meets U.S. Federal Information Processing requirements when
using cryptography to secure digital information.
      </p>
      <p>
The suites described in this specification use the RDF Dataset Normalization
Algorithm [[RDF-CANON]] or the JSON Canonicalization Scheme [[RFC8785]] to
transform an input document into its canonical form. The canonical
representation is then hashed and signed with a detached signature algorithm.
      </p>

      <section id="terminology">
        <h3>Terminology</h3>

        <p>
Terminology used throughout this document is defined in the
<a data-cite="VC-DATA-INTEGRITY#terminology">Terminology</a> section of the
[[[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]]] specification.
        </p>

      </section>

      <section id="conformance">
        <p>
A <dfn>conforming proof</dfn> is any concrete expression of the data model
that complies with the normative statements in this specification. Specifically,
all relevant normative statements in Sections
<a href="#data-model"></a> and <a href="#algorithms"></a>
of this document MUST be enforced.
        </p>

        <p>
A <dfn class="lint-ignore">conforming processor</dfn> is any algorithm realized
as software and/or hardware that generates or consumes a
<a>conforming proof</a>. Conforming processors MUST produce errors when
non-conforming documents are consumed.
        </p>
	<p>
This document contains examples of JSON and JSON-LD data. Some of these examples
are invalid JSON, as they include features such as inline comments (`//`)
explaining certain portions and ellipses (`...`) indicating the omission of
information that is irrelevant to the example. These parts would have to be
removed in order to treat the examples as valid JSON or JSON-LD.
        </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Model</h2>

      <p>
The following sections outline the data model that is used by this specification
to express verification methods, such as cryptographic public keys, and
data integrity proofs, such as digital signatures.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Verification Methods</h3>

        <p>
This cryptographic suite is used to verify Data Integrity Proofs
[[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]] produced using Edwards Curve cryptographic key material.
The encoding formats for those key types are provided in this section. Lossless
cryptographic key transformation processes that result in equivalent
cryptographic key material MAY be used for the processing of digital
signatures.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h4>Multikey</h4>

          <p>
The <a data-cite="VC-DATA-INTEGRITY#multikey">Multikey format</a>, defined in
[[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]], is used to express public keys for the cryptographic
suites defined in this specification.
          </p>

          <p>
The `publicKeyMultibase` value of the verification method MUST start with the
base-58-btc prefix (`z`), as defined in the
<a data-cite="VC-DATA-INTEGRITY#multibase-0">Multibase section</a> of
[[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]]. A Multibase-encoded Multikey value follows, which MUST
consist of a binary value that starts with the two-byte prefix `0xed01`, which
is the Multikey header for an Ed25519 public key, followed by the 32-byte public
key data, all of which is then encoded using base-58-btc. Any other encoding
MUST NOT be allowed.
          </p>

          <p class="advisement">
Developers are advised to not accidentally publish a representation of a private
key. Implementations of this specification will raise errors if they encounter a
Multikey prefix value other than `0xed01` in a `publicKeyMultibase` value.
          </p>

  "capabilityInvocation": [
    "did:example:123#key-0"
  ]
}
          </pre>

          <p>
The `secretKeyMultibase` property represents a Multibase-encoded Multikey
expression of an Ed25519 secret key (sometimes also referred to as a private
key). The value starts with the two-byte prefix `0x8026`,
followed by the 32-byte Ed25519 secret key data. The combined
34-byte value is then base58-btc encoded and `z` is added as the prefix on the
encoded value.
          </p>

          <p class="advisement">
Developers are advised to prevent accidental publication of a representation of
a secret key, and to not export the `secretKeyMultibase` property by default,
when serializing key pairs to Multikey.
          </p>

        <h3>Proof Representations</h3>

        <p>
This section details the proof representation formats that are defined by
this specification.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h4>DataIntegrityProof</h4>

          <p>
The `verificationMethod` property of the proof MUST be a URL.
Dereferencing the `verificationMethod` MUST result in an object
containing a `type` property with the value set to
`Multikey`.
          </p>

          <p>
The `type` property of the proof MUST be `DataIntegrityProof`.
          </p>
          <p>
The `cryptosuite` property of the proof MUST be `eddsa-rdfc-2022` or `eddsa-jcs-2022`.
          </p>
          <p>
The `created` property of the proof MUST be an [[XMLSCHEMA11-2]]
formatted date string.
          </p>
          <p>
The `proofPurpose` property of the proof MUST be a string, and MUST
match the verification relationship expressed by the verification method
`controller`.
          </p>
          <p>
The `proofValue` property of the proof MUST be a detached EdDSA
produced according to [[RFC8032]], encoded using the base-58-btc header and
alphabet as described in the
<a data-cite="VC-DATA-INTEGRITY#multibase-0">Multibase section</a> of
[[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]].

        <h3>eddsa-rdfc-2022</h3>

        <p>
The `eddsa-rdfc-2022` cryptographic suite takes an input document, canonicalizes
the document using the Universal RDF Dataset Canonicalization Algorithm
[[RDF-CANON]], and then cryptographically hashes and signs the output
resulting in the production of a data integrity proof. The algorithms in this
section also include the verification of such a data integrity proof.

        <p class="advisement">
When the RDF Dataset Canonicalization Algorithm [[RDF-CANON]] is used,
implementations will detect <a data-cite="RDF-CANON#dataset-poisoning">

        <h3>Security Properties of Ed25519 Implementations</h3>
        <p>Ed25519 signatures (EdDSA algorithm with edwards25519 curve) have
        been widely adopted, due both to the compact size of the keys and
        signatures and to the speed at
which signatures can be produced and verified. Many libraries exist that can
create and verify Ed25519 signatures. Since the publication of [[RFC8032]],
security properties of Ed25519 signatures have been rigorously proven (see
[[Provable_Ed25519]] and [[Taming_EdDSAs]]). However, it has been observed that a
significant number of libraries do not achieve these security levels, due to
missing input validity checks during the signature verification process. In
this section, we summarize the security levels achievable with Ed25519
signatures, and indicate how one can determine whether a library will support those
levels.

          <h4>Achieving Ed25519 Security Properties</h4>
          <p>As pointed on in [[Taming_EdDSAs]] flaws in Ed25519 libraries
primarily occur on the signature verification side where sometimes edge cases
are not properly checked. An Ed25519 signature library that is in conformance
with [[RFC8032]] or [[FIPS-186-5]], i.e., one that performs <strong>all
</strong> specified validation checks, will have the <strong>SUF-CMA</strong>
property in addition to <strong>EUF-CMA</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>Reference [[Taming_EdDSAs]] achieves the <strong>BS</strong> and
<strong>SBS</strong> properties along with <strong>SUF-CMA</strong> in their
&quot;signature verification algorithm 2&quot; where an additional check is
performed against the public key <em>A</em> to make sure that it is not one of
eight &quot;small order points&quot;. These additional checks incur minimal processing overhead.
          </p>
          <p>Reference [[Taming_EdDSAs]] included a set of twelve test vectors
to test various Ed25519 libraries available at the time of publication. They
found that a significant portion missed edge cases and hence did not achieve
<strong>SUF-CMA</strong> (just EUF-CMA) and only two libraries out of sixteen
achieved all the security properties. Since the time of publication more
Ed25519 libraries have been created and some of the libraries have been updated
to include all verification checks. Implementers are recommended to test the
Ed25519 library they are using against the test vectors of [[Taming_EdDSAs]].

            <p class="issue">
  We need to add documentation to note that this key format is deployed and
  widely used in production, but is deprecated. `Multikey` and `JsonWebKey2020`
  supersede it.
            </p>

            <p>
  The `type` of the verification method MUST be
  <a href="#ed25519verificationkey2020">Ed25519VerificationKey2020</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
  The `controller` of the verification method MUST be a URL.
            </p>

            <p>
  The `publicKeyMultibase` value of the verification method MUST start with the
  base-58-btc prefix (`z`), as defined in the
  <a data-cite="VC-DATA-INTEGRITY#multibase-0">Multibase section</a> of
  [[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]]. A Multibase-encoded Multikey value follows, which MUST
  consist of a binary value that starts with the two-byte prefix `0xed01`, which
  is the Multikey header for an Ed25519 public key, followed by the 32-byte
  public key data, all of which is then encoded using base-58-btc. Any other
  encoding MUST NOT be allowed.
            </p>

            <p class="advisement">
  Developers are advised to not accidentally publish a representation of a private
  key. Implementations of this specification will raise errors in the event of a
  Multikey header value other than `0xed01` being used in a
  `publicKeyMultibase` value.

        <h3>Representation: eddsa-rdfc-2022</h3>
        <p>
The signer needs to generate a private/public key pair with the private key used
for signing and the public key made available for verification. The
representation of the public key and the representation of the private key
are shown below.
        </p>
        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Private and Public keys for Signature">
{
    publicKeyMultibase: "z6MkrJVnaZkeFzdQyMZu1cgjg7k1pZZ6pvBQ7XJPt4swbTQ2",
    privateKeyMultibase: "z3u2en7t5LR2WtQH5PfFqMqwVHBeXouLzo6haApm8XHqvjxq"
}
        </pre>

        <p>
Signing begins with a credential without an attached proof, which is converted
to canonical form, and then hashed, as shown in the following three examples.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Credential without Proof" data-include="TestVectors/unsigned.json"
        data-include-format="text"></pre>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Canonical Credential without Proof" data-include="TestVectors/eddsa-rdfc-2022/canonDocDataInt.txt"
        data-include-format="text"></pre>


        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Hash of Canonical Credential without Proof (hex)"
        data-include="TestVectors/eddsa-rdfc-2022/docHashDataInt.txt" data-include-format="text"></pre>

        <p>
The next step is to take the proof options document, convert it to canonical form,
and obtain its hash, as shown in the next three examples.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Proof Options Document"
        data-include="TestVectors/eddsa-rdfc-2022/proofConfigDataInt.json" data-include-format="text"></pre>

        data-include="TestVectors/eddsa-rdfc-2022/proofCanonDataInt.txt" data-include-format="text"></pre>

        data-include="TestVectors/eddsa-rdfc-2022/proofHashDataInt.txt" data-include-format="text"></pre>

        <p>
Finally, we concatenate the hash of the proof options followed by the hash of the credential without proof, use the private key with the combined hash to
compute the Ed25519 signature, and then base58-btc encode the signature.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Combine hashes of Proof Options and Credential (hex)"
        data-include="TestVectors/eddsa-rdfc-2022/combinedHashDataInt.txt" data-include-format="text"></pre>

        data-include="TestVectors/eddsa-rdfc-2022/sigBTC58DataInt.txt" data-include-format="text"></pre>

        <p>Assemble the signed credential with the following two steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
Add the <code>proofValue</code> field with the previously computed base58-btc
value to the proof options document.
          </li>
          <li>
Set the <code>proof</code> field of the credential to the augmented proof
option document.

        <h3>Representation: eddsa-jcs-2022</h3>
        <p>
The signer needs to generate a private/public key pair with the private key used
for signing and the public key made available for verification. The
representation of the public key, and the representation of the private key
are shown below.
        </p>
        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Private and Public keys for Signature">
{
  publicKeyMultibase: "z6MkrJVnaZkeFzdQyMZu1cgjg7k1pZZ6pvBQ7XJPt4swbTQ2",

}
        </pre>

        <p>
Signing begins with a credential without an attached proof, which is converted
to canonical form, and then hashed, as shown in the following three examples.
        </p>

        data-include="TestVectors/eddsa-jcs-2022/docHashJCS.txt" data-include-format="text"></pre>

        <p>
The next step is to take the proof options document, convert it to canonical form,
and obtain its hash, as shown in the next three examples.
        </p>

        <p>
Finally, we concatenate the hash of the proof options followed by the hash of the credential without proof, use the private key with the combined hash to
compute the Ed25519 signature, and then base58-btc encode the signature.

        <h3>Proof Sets and Chains</h3>
        <p>
Proof sets and chains are defined in the [[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]]. We
provide test vectors showing the creation of proof sets and chains with the
`eddsa-rdfc-2022` cryptosuite. Multiple signers can be involved in the generation
of proof sets and chains so multiple public/private key pairs are needed. These
are shown below.

        <section>
          <h4>Proof Set</h4>
          <p>
To demonstrate creating a proof set, we start with a document containing a
single proof and add another proof to it. The starting document is shown below and
contains a proof signed with `keyPair1`.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Starting Document for Proof Set" data-include="TestVectors/proof-set-chain/signedProofSet1.json"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>
          <p>
The `options` input to <a data-cite="vc-data-integrity#add-proof-set/chain">
Section 4.4: Add Proof Set/Chain</a> in [[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]]
is shown below. Note that it does not include a `previousProof` attribute since
we are constructing a proof set and not a chain. In addition, we will be using
`keyPair2` for signing.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Proof Options for Set" data-include="TestVectors/proof-set-chain/proofSetConfig2.json"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>
          <p>
Per the algorithm of <a data-cite="vc-data-integrity#add-proof-set/chain">
Section 4.4: Add Proof Set/Chain</a> in [[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]],
we create an array variable, <var>allProofs</var>, and add the proof from the
starting document to it. Since there is no `previousProof` attribute, no
modification of `unsignedDocument` is needed prior to computing the signed proof
in step 6 of <a data-cite="vc-data-integrity#add-proof-set/chain">
Section 4.4: Add Proof Set/Chain</a> in
[[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]]. The signed proof configuration is shown below.

          data-include-format="text"></pre>
          <p>
The signed proof `options` above gets appended to the <var>allProofs</var>
variable, which then gets set as the `proof` attribute of the unsigned document
to produce the final signed document as shown below.

          <h4>Proof Chain with Multiple Dependencies</h4>
          <p>
This collection of test vectors demonstrates the construction a proof chain. We
start with a document containing a proof set, i.e., our previous example, and
then add a new proof to the credential that has a dependency on the existing
proofs. This example also demonstrates the case where the `previousProofs`
attribute is an array. This example uses `keyPair3` and the starting document is
given below.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Starting Document for Proof Chain" data-include="TestVectors/proof-set-chain/signedProofSet2.json"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>
          <p>
The `options` input to <a data-cite="vc-data-integrity#add-proof-set/chain">
Section 4.4: Add Proof Set/Chain</a> in [[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]]
is shown below. Note that it includes a `previousProof` attribute since we are
constructing a proof chain.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Options for Proof Chain" data-include="TestVectors/proof-set-chain/proofChainConfig1.json"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>
          <p>
Per the algorithm of <a data-cite="vc-data-integrity#add-proof-set/chain">
Section 4.4: Add Proof Set/Chain</a> in [[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]],
we create an array variable, <var>allProofs</var>, and add the proofs from the
starting document to it. Since the options contains the `previousProof`
attribute, we compute the <var>matchingProofs</var> variable per step 4
of <a data-cite="vc-data-integrity#add-proof-set/chain">Section 4.4: Add Proof
Set/Chain</a>, and we set the
<var>unsecuredDocument.proof</var> equal to the <var>matchingProofs</var>. This
produces the document shown below.

          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Temporary Unsecured Document for Binding Previous Proofs" data-include="TestVectors/proof-set-chain/proofChainTempDoc1.json"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>
          <p>
In step 6, we use the previous document (unsecured document with previous proofs
added to it) to compute the `proofValue` attribute. This gives the signed
configuration options (proof) shown below:
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Signed Configuration Options (proof)" data-include="TestVectors/proof-set-chain/proofChainConfigSigned1.json"
          data-include-format="text"></pre>
          <p>
The signed proof `options` above gets appended to the <var>allProofs</var>
variable, which then gets set as the `proof` attribute of the unsigned document
to produce the final signed document as shown below.
          </p>

          <h4>Extended Proof Chain</h4>
          <p>
This collection of test vectors demonstrates construction of an extended proof
chain. We start with the output of the previous section and add an additional
proof that is dependent on one of the existing proofs. This example uses
`keyPair4`, and the starting document is given below.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Starting Document for Extended Proof Chain" data-include="TestVectors/proof-set-chain/signedProofChain1.json"

The `options` input to <a data-cite="vc-data-integrity#add-proof-set/chain">
Section 4.4: Add Proof Set/Chain</a> in [[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]]
is shown below. Note that it includes a `previousProof` attribute since we are
constructing a proof chain, however this time it is a single value.
          </p>
          <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Options for Extended Proof Chain" data-include="TestVectors/proof-set-chain/proofChainConfig2.json"

we create an array variable, <var>allProofs</var>, and add the proofs from the

          <p>
In step 6, we use the previous document (unsecured document with previous proofs
