      <p>
This specification describes a Data Integrity cryptographic suite for use when
creating or verifying a digital signature using the twisted Edwards Curve
Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) and Curve25519 (ed25519). The approach is
accepted by the U.S. National Institute of Standards in the latest FIPS 186-5
draft and, after ratification, is expected to meet U.S. Federal Information
Processing requirements when using cryptography to secure digital information.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="sotd">
      <p>
This is an experimental specification and is undergoing regular revisions. It is
not fit for production deployment.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
This specification defines a cryptographic suite for the purpose of creating,
verifying proofs for Ed25519 EdDSA signatures in conformance with the
Data Integrity [[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]] specification.
      </p>
      <p>
In general the suites uses the RDF Dataset Normalization Algorithm
[[RDF-CANON]] to transform an input document into its canonical
form. The cannonical representation is then hashed and signed with a detached
signature algorithm.
      </p>

      <section id="terminology">
        <h2>Terminology</h2>
        <p>
The following terms are used to describe concepts involved in the generation and
verification of the Data Integrity cryptographic suite.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><dfn>Ed25519VerificationKey2020</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
The `type` of the verification method for the signature suite
<a>Ed25519Signature2020</a>.
          </dd>

          <dt><dfn>Ed25519Signature2020</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
The `type` of the linked data proof for the signature suite
<a>Ed25519Signature2020</a>.
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </section>

      <section id="conformance">
        <p>
A <dfn>conforming proof</dfn> is any concrete expression of the data model
that complies with the normative statements in this specification. Specifically,
all relevant normative statements in Sections
<a href="#data-model"></a> and <a href="#algorithms"></a>
of this document MUST be enforced.
        </p>

        <p>
A <dfn class="lint-ignore">conforming processor</dfn> is any algorithm realized
as software and/or hardware that generates or consumes a
<a>conforming proof</a>. Conforming processors MUST produce errors when
non-conforming documents are consumed.
        </p>
        <p>
This document also contains examples that contain JSON and JSON-LD content. Some
of these examples contain characters that are invalid JSON, such as inline
comments (`//`) and the use of ellipsis (`...`) to denote
information that adds little value to the example. Implementers are cautioned to
remove this content if they desire to use the information as valid JSON or
JSON-LD.
        </p>
      </section>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Model</h2>

      <p>
The following sections outline the data model that is used by this specification
for verification methods and signature formats.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Verification Methods</h2>
        <p>
The cryptographic material used to verify a linked data proof is called the
verification method. This suite relies on public key material represented using
[[MULTIBASE]] and [[MULTICODEC]]. This suite supports public key use for both
digital signature generation and verification, according to [[RFC8032]].
        </p>

        <p>
This suite MAY be used to verify Data Integrity Proofs [[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]]
produced by Ed25519 public key material encoded as either a
<a>Ed25519VerificationKey2020</a> or <a href="#multikey">Multikey</a>. Loss-less
key transformation processes that result in equivalent cryptographic material
MAY be utilized.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h3>Multikey</h3>

          <p class="issue">
This definition should go in the Data Integrity specification and referenced
from there.
          </p>

          <p>
The `type` of the verification method MUST be `Multikey`.
          </p>

          <p>
The `controller` of the verification method MUST be a URL.
          </p>

          <p>
The `publicKeyMultibase` property of the verification method MUST be
a public key encoded according to [[MULTICODEC]] and formatted according to
[[MULTIBASE]]. The multicodec encoding of a Ed25519 public key is the two-byte
prefix `0xed01` followed by the 32-byte public key data. The 34 byte
value is then encoded using base58-btc (`z`) as the prefix. Any other encoding
MUST NOT be allowed.
          </p>

          <p class="advisement">
Developers are advised to not accidentally publish a representation of a private
key. Implementations of this specification will raise errors in the event of a
[[MULTICODEC]] value other than `0xed01` being used in a
`publicKeyMultibase` value.

      <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
      <p>
The following section describes security considerations that developers
implementing this specification should be aware of in order to create secure
software.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
This specification relies on URDNA2015, please review
[[RDF-CANON]].
      </p>

      <p class="note">
This specification relies on [[MULTIBASE]], [[MULTICODEC]] and [[RFC8032]].
      </p>

      <p class="issue">
There are <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1244.pdf">
known mis-implementation attacks against multiple flavors of EdDSA</a>
implementations. We might want to warn about what to look out for and how to
mitigate the attacks.

      <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>
      <p>
The following section describes privacy considerations that developers
implementing this specification should be aware of in order to avoid violating
privacy assumptions.

      <p class="issue">
This cryptography suite does not provide for selective disclosure or
unlinkability. If signatures are re-used, they can be used as correlatable data.
